st.title('Simulation of Accelerated AI Progress')

st.markdown(r"""
This tool allows users to enter their own parameterizations for the accompanying post on the pace of AI progress.
It offers two simulation options:

- **Multiple Simulations:** Run several simulations with uncertainty over key parameters. The output is a table showing the fraction of simulations where the average pace of software progress exceeds a specified threshold over some number of years.
- **Single Simulation:** Run a single simulation under specific parameter values to illustrate the path of AI progress, including the evolution of diminishing research productivity and growth rates over time.

The simulation assumes that compute remains constant over time.

In addition to model parameters, you can select whether to enable additional model specifications:
- **Retraining Cost:** Reduce the degree of acceleration as some software efficiency gains are spent making training happen more quickly. 
- **Gradual Boost:** The initial speed-up from ASARA ramps up gradually over 5 years.
- **Constant Diminishing Returns:** Assumes that $r$ is fixed at its initial value over time.

st.markdown("#### Sampling")
st.markdown(
r"When 'Multiple Simulations' is selected, randomization occurs over log-uniform distributions for $f$, $r_0$, and $p$, while the years until the ceiling are randomized over a uniform distribution. The bounds for these distributions come from the sidebar inputs. Note that we don't sample over the fraction of AI progress due to software progress, but instead leave this as a deterministic parameter."

- Research investment combines human labor ($L$) and compute ($C$)
